	<p class="yah2">The most common way someone becomes a profesional baseball player is through the MLB draft. You can either enter the draft after high school or after college. After a player is drafted, they will sighn a sighning bonus and their contract. Then they will join the team and most likely start off in the minor leagues. It takes most minor league players a couple years to make it to the major leagues. Only about 10% of minor league players will ever play in a major league game. It is a long and difficult journey to become a major league player.</p>
